## Projects

### 1. Identifying patterns which determine success of video games
**Project description:** An online store which sells video games all over the world is planning an advertising campaign for the next year. Historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (for example, Xbox or PlayStation) are available from open sources. You need to identify the patterns that determine the success of the game. This will allow you to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.

**Status:** completed

**Result:** patterns which determine the succes of a video game in different regions were revelead. Potentially profitable products were indetified and proposed for the advertising campaign. Specific customer profiles were compiled for each region. Statistical tests were used to check hypotheses: average user ratings for Xbox One and PC platforms are the same; the average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different.

### 2. ML in business: risk and revenue prediction in oil industry
**Project description:** The goal of the project is to predict the possible revenue of oil extraction in new regions of exploration using machine learning models on data from oil samples taken in different regions. Furthermore the risk of losses (negative revenue) should be statistically calculated using *Bootstrap* in compliance with the given budget .<br>

**Status:** completed<br>

**Result:** a predictive model was built using linear regression. The region with the lowest risk of loss and with the potentially highest revenue was proposed for development of new oil extraction points.<br>
